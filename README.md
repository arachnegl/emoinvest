Takes the emotion out of investing!
First of all this is just a toy project for me to learn setting up new projects properly and to work with technologies
such as docker, git, celery and of course python. Aside from that the basic idea is to create a tool that detects and
notifies buy and sell points to users for various stock markets. In this scenario you have everything a data project
needs: data must come from somewhere, needs to be stored somewhere and used for calculations. In the end there might
even be some fancy visualisations etc.
